"""cognitive_loop_v1.py — single-file aggregation of the PRAGMI substrate.

The 22 substrate modules from the genesislabs-research/Pragmi-Cognitive-Loop_v1
repository concatenated verbatim with section banners between them, plus the
run_all.py test harness at the end. Every line of every source file is preserved.

There are no cross-module imports between the substrate files in the source
repository (each `_t.py` file pulls only stdlib + torch). The `# [aggregator]`
comment-out pattern from timmy_v2.py is therefore not needed here. The only
mechanical change applied is that every in-place `from __future__ import
annotations` line has been commented out and a single canonical copy lifted to
the top of this file (Python requires `__future__` imports there).

Module order (top to bottom of file):

  Input gating and primary sensory:
    thalamic_gate, primary_sensory_cortex, dorsal_ventral_streams.
  Cortical machinery:
    cortical_interneurons, layer5b_apical, association_cortex, claustrum.
  Subcortical selection and monitoring:
    basal_ganglia, anterior_cingulate_cortex, cerebellum, amygdala.

  Sleep and oscillatory coordination:

WARNING: ca2_t_part1.py in the source repository is truncated mid-line (file
ends with the partial token "supramammillary mod"). It is included here exactly
as it appears in the repo, fronted by an explicit TRUNCATED banner. Do not
attempt to import or instantiate anything from the ca2_part1 section until the
upstream file is completed; the dataclass at the bottom of that section is
syntactically incomplete and will not parse on its own.

Loop Stage 1: Thalamic Gate with TRN-Mediated Cross-Modal Routing

BIOLOGICAL GROUNDING
The thalamic gate is the first stage of the PRAGMI loop. The classical
description of this stage as a multiplicative sigmoid gate captures
the input-output behavior but understates the underlying circuitry.
The empirical pathway is a four-stage cascade:

    1. PFC carries a contextual control signal carrying current goals
       and conflict.
    2. PFC routes through inhibitory projections to basal ganglia
       (Nakajima, Schmitt, Halassa 2019).
    3. Basal ganglia inhibits modality-specific sectors of the
       thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), which itself is inhibitory.
    4. TRN disinhibits the corresponding thalamocortical relay
       neurons in the attended thalamic nucleus, producing the
       gain amplification that the cortex receives as attention.

The key quantitative result from Gu, Lam, Wimmer, Halassa, Murray
(2021) is that top-down inhibition onto TRN is 6 to 7 times more
potent at modulating thalamocortical gain than direct top-down
excitation onto thalamocortical relay neurons. This is a disinhibitory
geometry and the convex f-I curve of TRN neurons is what produces
the multiplier. A faithful implementation cannot collapse the four
stages into a single sigmoid without losing the empirical magnitudes.

This file implements the four-stage cascade with each stage as an
independently ablatable submodule so that the contribution of each
stage to the overall gain is measurable.

Loop Stage 2: Primary Sensory Cortex (V1/A1)

BIOLOGICAL GROUNDING
Primary sensory cortex performs the first stage of cortical
processing on thalamocortical input. The defining computation is
center-surround receptive field organization formed by the
difference-of-Gaussians (DoG) operation. Hubel and Wiesel (1962)
documented the simple-cell tuning that emerges from convergent LGN
input with center-surround structure; Marr (1982) formalized the
DoG model as the canonical edge-detection filter.

The same architectural principle applies in primary auditory cortex
(A1) for tonotopic frequency analysis, with bandpass tuning curves
that are the auditory analog of V1 simple cells. This file
implements both V1 (visual) and A1 (auditory) as parallel filter
banks with the same underlying DoG operation, since the loop stage
treats them as parallel modality-specific feature extractors.

Loop Stage 3: Dorsal and Ventral Visual Stream Split

BIOLOGICAL GROUNDING
After primary sensory cortex, visual information bifurcates into two
processing streams. The dorsal stream runs from V1 through V2 and
V5/MT to posterior parietal cortex and supports spatial location and
action guidance ("where" and "how"). The ventral stream runs from V1
through V2 and V4 to inferior temporal cortex and supports object
identity ("what"). Mishkin and Ungerleider (1982) and Goodale and
Milner (1992) are the foundational papers.

The same dual-stream organization holds in audition, with the dorsal
auditory stream supporting spatial localization and the ventral
auditory stream supporting object/voice recognition. Rauschecker and
Tian (2000) document the parallel.

The PRAGMI loop treats these as parallel cortical pathways that
project independently to association cortex, where multimodal
binding occurs. The split itself is implemented as a routing module
that takes V1/A1 features and emits dorsal and ventral
representations with distinct projection weights, with each stream
independently ablatable.

Cortical Interneuron Triplet: PV, SST, VIP

BIOLOGICAL GROUNDING
Cortex computes through dynamic interplay of excitatory pyramidal
cells and inhibitory interneurons. Of the 30+ molecular interneuron
classes, three carry the bulk of the functional load:
parvalbumin-positive (PV), somatostatin-positive (SST), and
vasoactive intestinal peptide-positive (VIP).

PV cells are fast-spiking basket cells. They contact pyramidal cell
somata and proximal dendrites and provide perisomatic gain control.
PV inhibition is the substrate of gamma-band oscillations.

SST cells (Martinotti cells in particular) target distal apical
dendrites. They gate the integration of top-down inputs onto the
apical tuft of layer 5 pyramidal cells. SST is slow.

VIP cells preferentially inhibit SST cells, producing a
disinhibitory motif: VIP active means SST suppressed means apical
dendrite released. This is the substrate of selective top-down
attention to specific cortical populations.

Connectivity matrix: Pfeffer, Xue, He, Huang, Scanziani (2013) and
Jiang et al. (2015) provide the empirical connection probabilities
and unitary EPSP/IPSP amplitudes among these classes.

Time constants from Garcia del Molino et al. (2017): PV and
pyramidal at approximately 10 ms, SST at 30 to 50 ms reflecting
the longer integration window of Martinotti cells.

Functional grammar review: Kepecs and Fishell (2014).

Cortical Compartment: Layer 5b Pyramidal Apical Amplification

BIOLOGICAL GROUNDING
Layer 5b pyramidal cells are the major cortical output neurons,
projecting to subcortical targets including thalamus, brainstem,
and spinal cord. Their dendrites have a striking compartmental
structure: a basal dendritic tree near the soma in deep cortex, and
a long apical dendrite extending up to layer 1 where it forms an
apical tuft. Each compartment has its own active conductances and
synaptic input populations.

The functional implication, formalized by Shai et al. (2015), is
that L5b pyramidal cells implement a sigmoid-of-sigmoids
computation: bottom-up basal input is gated by top-down apical input
through a multiplicative coupling. When bottom-up input alone is
present, basal sigmoid responds but the apical sigmoid is silent and
the cell fires weakly. When apical input is also present, the
apical sigmoid activates the apical Ca-spike mechanism, which
multiplicatively boosts somatic firing. This is the cellular
mechanism for combining feedforward sensory drive with feedback
predictions.

Hay et al. (2011) provide a detailed biophysical model of L5b
including the apical Ca channels that produce the burst-firing mode.
Sacramento et al. (2018) cast the apical compartment as the substrate
for credit assignment: the apical signal carries the prediction error
that should drive plasticity at basal synapses. Phillips et al.
(2023) review the cognitive implications of this compartmentalization.

This module implements the sigmoid-of-sigmoids gate as a per-unit
operation: each output unit has a basal channel and an apical channel,
and the output is the product of the two sigmoids passed through a
final nonlinearity. The compartments and their interaction are each
independently ablatable.

Loop Stage 4: Association Cortex Multimodal Binding

BIOLOGICAL GROUNDING
Association cortex is the convergence zone where dorsal and ventral
streams meet, where unimodal representations combine into multimodal
percepts, and where top-down feedback returns to lower areas.
Damasio (1989) introduced the convergence-divergence zone account
of association cortex; Mesulam (1990) elaborated the large-scale
network organization. Friston (2010) formalized the bidirectional
nature of cortical processing as predictive coding, in which
top-down predictions and bottom-up prediction errors interact at
every level.

A computational instantiation suited to PRAGMI is the mixture of
experts (MoE) architecture: Shazeer et al. (2017) and Eigen et al.
(2014). Different cortical patches act as experts specialized for
different feature combinations; a gating network routes input to
the most appropriate experts. This matches the empirical observation
that different prefrontal-parietal-temporal subregions activate for
different cognitive tasks despite shared global anatomy.

This file implements association cortex as a small MoE bank with
bidirectional feedback to lower-level streams. The MoE binding
component, the gating router, and the top-down feedback are each
independently ablatable.

Loop Stage: Claustrum Multimodal Synchronizer

BIOLOGICAL GROUNDING
The claustrum is a thin sheet of subcortical gray matter receiving
projections from nearly every cortical area and projecting back to
nearly every cortical area. Crick and Koch (2005) proposed it as a
binding hub for unified conscious experience. Recent computational
accounts position it as a multimodal synchronizer rather than a
content store: it does not represent specific information but
coordinates the timing and selection of cortical activations.

Reser (2019) provides a developed timing-mechanism account: the
claustrum receives convergent cortical input, computes a global
salience signal, and emits a brief synchronizing pulse that aligns
cortical processing across regions for the next cycle. Grimstvedt et
al. (2024) characterize fast inhibition microcircuits within the
claustrum that support precise burst timing. Madden et al. (2022)
show network-impulse computational role: NICC = Network Impulse
Cell-of-Claustrum. Goll, Atlan, Citri (2015) review broader
attentional functions.

This module implements a claustrum component that:
1. Pools cortical input (multimodal convergence)
2. Computes a salience score
3. Emits a temporally precise synchronizing pulse when salience
   exceeds threshold
4. Applies the pulse as a multiplicative boost across registered
   cortical targets

Loop Stage 7: Basal Ganglia Disinhibitory Gating

BIOLOGICAL GROUNDING
The basal ganglia implement action selection through disinhibition
rather than through softmax-style competitive excitation. Each
candidate action channel has a baseline tonic inhibition imposed by
GPi/SNr output. Striatal direct-pathway activation removes
inhibition from the chosen channel; indirect-pathway activation adds
inhibition to competitor channels. The hyperdirect pathway from
cortex to STN provides fast broad suppression before fine selection.

Mink (1996) is the canonical reference for this architecture. The
sharp departure from standard deep learning is that selection is
local: each channel knows its own striatal activation and the
dopamine signal, not the activations of competing channels. This
gives robustness to adversarial inputs on unrelated channels and
graceful degradation when dopamine is low.

This file implements the direct, indirect, and hyperdirect pathways
as independently ablatable submodules.

Loop Stage: ACC Conflict Detection

BIOLOGICAL GROUNDING
The anterior cingulate cortex monitors response conflict and emits a
control signal that modulates downstream attention and gain. The
canonical Botvinick et al. (2001) framework treats conflict as the
overlap of competing response activations; entropy of the response
distribution is the canonical PRAGMI form.

Botvinick et al. (1999) further document a sequential dependency:
ACC activation peaks on incompatible trials that follow compatible
trials, not on incompatible trials that follow other incompatible
trials. The system is most engaged when conflict rises unexpectedly.
A faithful implementation includes a temporal-derivative term with a
hinge at zero.

This file implements both the entropy-based instantaneous conflict
and the rising-conflict derivative term, with each component
independently ablatable.

Loop Stage 8: Cerebellum Efference Copy + Forward Models

BIOLOGICAL GROUNDING
The cerebellum implements forward models that predict the sensory
consequences of motor and cognitive commands. The classic Wolpert,
Miall, Kawato (1998) MPFIM framework treats the cerebellum as a
bank of paired forward-inverse modules, each tuned to a different
context.

Popa and Ebner (2019) show that individual Purkinje cells maintain
two independent forward models: an implicit kinematic model
predicting effector state, and an explicit task-performance model
predicting whether the action achieves its goal. The two dissociate
experimentally.

The cerebellum is also functionally zoned. Apps and Garwicz (2005)
identify three zonal divisions with distinct climbing fiber sources:
vestibulocerebellum (VOR feedback, retinal slip error),
spinocerebellum (limb position forward model, proprioceptive error),
and cerebrocerebellum (cognitive operations forward model, cortical
errors via parvocellular red nucleus). Each zone is approximately
250 micrometers wide as a sagittal microzone strip.

This file implements the dual-forward-model architecture in three
zonal configurations, with each zone independently ablatable.

Loop Stage: Amygdala Emotional Consolidation Tagging

BIOLOGICAL GROUNDING
The amygdala provides emotional valence tagging that biases which
hippocampal memory traces will be preferentially consolidated. The
basolateral amygdala (BLA) projects directly to ventral hippocampus
and indirectly modulates dorsal hippocampus through entorhinal
cortex and the locus coeruleus pathway. Girardeau, Inema, Buzsaki
(2017) document BLA-hippocampus replay coupling during sleep:
hippocampal sharp-wave ripples that co-occur with BLA reactivation
are preferentially preserved into long-term memory, a mechanism
later termed "emotional tagging".

Wei, Krishnan, Bazhenov (2016) provide the computational instantiation:
emotional salience computed at BLA modulates the consolidation gain
applied to hippocampal traces during sleep replay. McGaugh (2004)
reviews the broader stress-hormone amplification of memory.

In the PRAGMI loop, the amygdala module computes an emotional
salience scalar from current state and emits a consolidation tag
that scales how strongly a memory trace from the hippocampus will be
imprinted into the cognitive kernel during the next sleep cycle.
This is a Genesis-specific extension: in vivo the emotional tagging
acts on hippocampal-cortical replay; here we route it through the
kernel's consolidation pathway.

GENESIS-SPECIFIC EXTENSION: The emotional tag is routed to the
cognitive kernel's consolidation pathway rather than acting only on
hippocampal replay. This is an architectural choice that extends the
biological grounding to fit PRAGMI's three-layer separation. The
qualitative behavior (high-salience traces preferentially preserved)
matches the empirical phenomenon.

Cognitive Kernel: Entorhinal Cortex with Medial/Lateral Subdivision

BIOLOGICAL GROUNDING
The entorhinal cortex is the primary gateway between neocortex and
hippocampus. It is not a single homogeneous structure. Medial and
lateral entorhinal cortex (MEC and LEC) are functionally and
anatomically distinct subdivisions with different cortical input
sources, different projection targets within hippocampus, and
different computational roles.

MEC carries spatial and self-motion information. Grid cells in MEC
layer II provide a metric for space. MEC projects predominantly to
dentate gyrus and CA3, where pattern separation orthogonalizes the
spatial code before storage in the CA3 attractor network.

LEC carries non-spatial content: object identity, social identity,
odor, and contextual features. LEC projects directly to CA2 via the
recently characterized direct pathway documented by Lopez-Rojas et
al. (2022), bypassing dentate gyrus pattern separation. This makes
sense functionally: identity matching at CA2 requires preserved
representational structure, which DG orthogonalization would destroy.

The kernel's previous EntorhinalCortex module emitted a single output
tensor that was used for both the DG/CA3 path and (in the new CA2
module) the direct CA2 path. This file replaces that module with a
two-output version that separates MEC and LEC contributions, so that
the anatomical distinction is real rather than labeled. Both
subdivisions still share the short-term buffer and the input
normalization that the original module provided, because both EC
subdivisions show persistent firing properties grounded in Egorov et
al. (2002).

Cognitive Kernel: CA1 Subfield with Ternary Conjunction

BIOLOGICAL GROUNDING
CA1 is the primary output region of the hippocampal trisynaptic
circuit. It receives three converging inputs: the Schaffer collateral
projection from CA3 carrying the pattern-completed spatial code, the
direct temporoammonic projection from EC layer III carrying current
sensory drive, and the Schaffer collateral projection from CA2
carrying the temporal drift signal and identity comparator output.
The conjunction of these three streams at CA1 produces the
hippocampal output code that combines spatial position, sensory
context, and time-stamp/identity into a single representation.

CA1 also acts as a comparator. The classic Lisman and Grace (2005)
account treats CA1 as a novelty detector that compares the CA3
reconstruction against direct EC input; mismatch triggers
hippocampal-VTA loop activation and gates downstream learning. The
addition of CA2 input refines this picture: CA1 now distinguishes
spatial novelty (CA3 vs EC mismatch) from identity novelty (carried
by CA2 mismatch), and the temporal drift component of the CA2 signal
provides the time-stamp that lets CA1 distinguish repeated visits to
the same place.

This file replaces the previous CA1Comparator that took two inputs
(Schaffer from CA3, direct from EC) with a CA1 module that takes
three (Schaffer from CA3, Schaffer from CA2, direct from EC). The
ternary conjunction logic uses the existing novelty gate to balance
CA3 reconstruction against EC drive, then incorporates the CA2
contribution as an additive temporal/identity overlay rather than as
a competing reconstruction.

Cognitive Kernel: CA2 Subfield (Temporal Drift Generator and Social Memory Comparator)

BIOLOGICAL GROUNDING
This file implements the hippocampal CA2 subfield, the third hippocampal
pyramidal cell region between CA3 and CA1. CA2 was historically treated as
a passive transition zone between CA3 and CA1; the last decade established
it as a functionally distinct module with its own input pathway, its own
plasticity regime, and its own role in the larger trisynaptic circuit.

CA2 has two architectural commitments in PRAGMI. First, it is the temporal
drift generator. Population activity in CA2 drifts substantially across
hours within the same spatial environment, more than CA1 and far more than
CA3. CA1 receives stable spatial input from CA3 plus time-varying input
from CA2; the conjunction at CA1 produces a place-plus-time-stamp code
that is the substrate of episodic (rather than semantic) memory. Second,
CA2 is a comparator rather than an encoder. High RGS14 expression
suppresses LTP at CA3-to-CA2 synapses, which means CA2 does not write new
content into its recurrent weights the way CA3 does. It compares current
input against stored representation and emits a mismatch signal. This
matches the social-memory function: recognizing whether a conspecific is
familiar requires comparing current sensory input against a stored
identity representation, not encoding a new identity from scratch.

The direct lateral entorhinal cortex layer II projection to CA2 carries
social and contextual content that bypasses dentate gyrus pattern
separation entirely. This is the pathway by which CA2 receives input
that is not orthogonalized, which is correct for the comparator function:
pattern separation would destroy the identity match that CA2 needs to
detect.

Cognitive Kernel: Hippocampal Subfield CA2 (Temporal Drift Generator)

BIOLOGICAL GROUNDING
This file models hippocampal subfield CA2, a small region between CA3 and
CA1 that for decades was treated as a passive relay. Modern work shows it
is neither passive nor a relay. CA2 is the structure that injects temporal
variability into the hippocampal code, distinguishing episodic memory
(time-indexed) from semantic memory (time-invariant). It is also the
hippocampal hub for social memory.

The architectural commitment of this file is that CA2 is a sibling to CA3,
not a downstream stage. CA3 is a recurrent attractor that suppresses drift
and stabilizes spatial codes through pattern completion. CA2 is a drift
generator that produces structured temporal variability across hours within
the same spatial environment. CA1 receives both: stable spatial input from
CA3 via the proximal Schaffer collaterals, and time-varying input from CA2
via the distal Schaffer-like projection. The conjunction at CA1 produces
a code that carries both place-stamp and time-stamp, which is what
"episodic" means at the algorithmic level.

CA2 plasticity is suppressed relative to CA3 by high RGS14 expression. The
functional consequence is that CA2 acts as a comparator between current
input and stored representation rather than as an encoder of new content.
This file implements that asymmetry by giving CA2 a much smaller plasticity
update than the CA3 attractor uses.

CA2 also has a direct projection from lateral entorhinal cortex layer II
that bypasses the dentate gyrus entirely, carrying social-context and
novelty information. The supramammillary nucleus provides a separate
modulatory input that scales the drift rate. Output goes to CA1 distal
dendrites for the place-plus-time conjunction, and to ventral CA1 for the
social-memory readout pathway.

Loop Stage: VTA Dopamine Reward Prediction Error

BIOLOGICAL GROUNDING
The ventral tegmental area is the primary midbrain source of
dopamine to the forebrain. Its output is canonically interpreted as
a reward prediction error signal (RPE), formalized by Montague,
Dayan, and Sejnowski (1996) as the temporal difference (TD) error
in reinforcement learning.

The TD computation is:
    delta(t) = r(t) + gamma * V(s(t)) - V(s(t-1))

where r is the immediate reward, V is the predicted sum of future
discounted rewards, and gamma is the discount factor. The dopamine
signal validates against Schultz, Apicella, Ljungberg recordings:
neurons fire to unexpected reward, transfer their response to the
predictive cue after learning, and pause below baseline when an
expected reward is omitted.

This file implements the basic TD computation. The distributional
update of Dabney et al. (2020) and the population diversity in
discount factors of Eshel et al. (2016) are noted in the architecture
but not implemented in the basic version; they can be added as
extensions if measurable benefit appears on the demo task.

Loop Stage: Locus Coeruleus Norepinephrine Computation

BIOLOGICAL GROUNDING
The locus coeruleus is a small brainstem nucleus that supplies most
of the norepinephrine to the forebrain. It is the canonical source
of the NE signal that scales gain in the thalamic gate, modulates
attention precision, and drives reset of context belief on
unexpected uncertainty.

Yu and Dayan (2005) formalize NE as the unexpected uncertainty
signal: the part of prediction error that cannot be explained by
within-context variance (which is acetylcholine's domain). The
operational form is the negative log probability of the current
observation under the active context model, integrated over a short
window and bounded by soft normalization. When NE crosses a
threshold, the system resets context belief and elevates learning
rates, which behaves like a Kalman filter switching between
covariance regimes.

Dayan and Yu (2006) extend the framework to phasic NE, treating the
phasic burst as a neural interrupt signal for unexpected events
within the current task. Nassar, Wilson, Heasly, Gold (2010) provide
the explicit pseudocode-level update rules in a changing-environment
delta-rule framework.

This file implements the LC as a module that takes an instantaneous
observation log-likelihood under the current context model and emits
both a tonic NE level and a phasic burst signal. The thalamic gate
honors NE through the existing ne_gain hook.

Loop Stage: Dorsal Raphe Nucleus Serotonin Source

BIOLOGICAL GROUNDING
The dorsal raphe nucleus is the primary midbrain source of forebrain
serotonin (5-HT). Its functional role is multifaceted: serotonin
encodes patience for delayed reward (Miyazaki et al. 2014), modulates
risk and aversion (Cools, Roberts, Robbins 2008), and provides a
slow opponent signal to dopamine in reinforcement learning (Daw,
Kakade, Dayan 2002).

The Daw et al. (2002) opponent-process account is most directly
implementable: where dopamine signals positive prediction error,
serotonin signals an inverse, scaled by an aversion-sensitivity
parameter. The two systems together produce balanced exploitation
of positive and negative outcomes, with depression understood as a
serotonin deficit producing impaired punishment learning.

Cohen, Amoroso, Uchida (2015) document that DRN 5-HT neurons fire
in response to both rewards and punishments, supporting a salience-
based account in addition to the opponent-process account. Boureau
and Dayan (2011) review the broader integration with motivation
and decision-making.

This file implements a DRN module emitting:
1. Tonic 5-HT level (slow drift toward an aversion-sensitivity scaled
   running average of negative TD errors)
2. Phasic 5-HT (instantaneous opponent of dopamine RPE)
3. Patience scalar suitable for biasing temporal discounting toward
   longer horizons when 5-HT is high

Loop Stage: Basal Forebrain Acetylcholine Source

BIOLOGICAL GROUNDING
The basal forebrain cholinergic system (nucleus basalis of Meynert,
medial septal nucleus, diagonal band of Broca) is the primary
source of cortical acetylcholine. ACh complements norepinephrine in
Yu and Dayan's (2005) uncertainty framework: where NE encodes
unexpected uncertainty (model is wrong), ACh encodes expected
uncertainty (model is correct but stochastic). Hasselmo (2006)
provides the developed account of ACh's role in modulating cortical
encoding versus retrieval modes.

High ACh produces an "encoding" mode: strong feedforward sensory
drive, suppressed feedback, enhanced LTP. Low ACh produces a
"retrieval" mode: stronger feedback recurrence, suppressed
feedforward, weaker LTP. This switch is functionally critical for
the kernel because the cognitive kernel needs encoding mode when
new memories are forming and retrieval mode when reconstructing
from existing traces.

Parikh, Kozak, Martinez, Sarter (2007) document phasic ACh release
events on the second timescale, supporting the role in transient
attentional engagement. Sarter, Lustig, Howe, Gritton, Berry (2014)
review the broader cognitive function.

This file implements an ACh source that emits:
1. Tonic ACh level (slow drift)
2. Phasic ACh transients (fast attentional events)
3. Mode signal (encoding / retrieval) for downstream gating

Sleep Stage Transition Oscillator

BIOLOGICAL GROUNDING
The sleep-wake cycle is governed by mutually inhibitory brainstem
populations whose dynamics are well characterized by flip-flop
models. Booth, Diniz Behn (2014) provide a four-population mean-field
model of NREM/REM/wake transitions. The wake-promoting populations
(LC, dorsal raphe, basal forebrain cholinergic) suppress sleep
populations (VLPO and pontine cholinergic), with mutual inhibition
producing bistable dynamics. Within sleep, the SLD (sublaterodorsal
nucleus) cholinergic population and ventrolateral periaqueductal
gray REM-off population compete to gate REM versus NREM.

Kumar, Bose, Mallick (2012) provide a mathematical analysis of REM
sleep regulation, demonstrating how slow homeostatic processes
(adenosine accumulation during wake, dissipation during sleep)
combine with fast flip-flop dynamics to produce the canonical 90 to
120 minute NREM-REM cycle.

This file implements a small flip-flop oscillator that emits
discrete sleep stage labels (wake / NREM / REM) and a homeostatic
sleep-pressure scalar. The kernel uses these to gate consolidation
and replay processes.

Sleep Replay: Spindle-Ripple Coupling Consolidation

BIOLOGICAL GROUNDING
During NREM sleep, the cortex generates slow oscillations (~0.5-1
Hz), the thalamus generates sleep spindles (~12-15 Hz, lasting
~1 second), and the hippocampus generates sharp-wave ripples
(~150-250 Hz, lasting ~50-150 ms). The temporal nesting of these
three rhythms is the substrate of memory consolidation: ripples
that occur within the trough of slow oscillations and within the
positive cycle of spindles preferentially drive cortical replay
that strengthens consolidated memory traces.

Wei, Krishnan, Bazhenov (2016) provide a mechanistic model showing
how spindle-ripple coupling drives synaptic plasticity at
hippocampal-cortical projections. Helfrich, Lendner, Knight (2024)
characterize the triple-nesting (slow oscillation x spindle x ripple)
and demonstrate causally that disruption of nesting impairs memory.
Mednick et al. (2011) show that sleep spindles correlate with
declarative memory improvement.

This file implements the spindle and ripple generators with phase
coupling, plus a consolidation-strength readout that depends on the
three-way phase alignment. The amygdala consolidation tag (when
provided) gates which traces are preferentially consolidated.
